In healthcare, improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a top priority. 
In this Power BI Case study, you’ll explore a real-world dataset to uncover hospital efficiency insights for a fictional consulting company called HealthStat. 
You’ll analyze attributes impacting the patient length of stay (LOS) and cost and work to identify factors contributing to hospital differences. 
You’ll leverage your DAX skills to create measures and generate insightful visualizations. 
To finish off, you’ll bring it all together in a sophisticated business dashboard to communicate insights for the HealthStat team. 


# 🏥 Power BI Healthcare Data Analysis

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze **hospital performance, patient discharge trends, and cost efficiency** using Power BI. The project provides data-driven insights to optimize **Length of Stay (LOS)**, **hospital utilization**, and **cost per discharge** across multiple hospitals.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Total Hospitals Analyzed**: 151
- **Total Patient Discharges**: 26,000
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Average Length of Stay (LOS) per Hospital**
  - **Total Discharges by Severity & Risk of Mortality**
  - **Cost per Discharge per Hospital**
  - **Hospital Performance Comparison**

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard Creation & Data Visualization
- **Power Query** – Data Extraction & Preprocessing, Data Cleaning & Structuring

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Identified variations in Length of Stay (LOS)** from **1.4 to 12.0 days**, helping hospitals improve patient turnover and resource allocation.
2. **Analyzed cost per discharge**, showing a wide range from **$7,700 to $85,000**, enabling hospitals to optimize financial efficiency.
3. **Segmented patient discharge data by severity of illness**, highlighting trends that help in hospital capacity planning.
4. **Top-performing hospitals** were identified based on efficiency metrics, guiding best practices for other institutions.

## 🎯 Conclusion
- The dashboard provides **actionable insights** for hospital administrators to **reduce patient stay duration, optimize resource allocation, and control healthcare costs**.
- Further analysis can incorporate **predictive modeling** to anticipate hospital needs and improve patient outcomes.
