## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze **hospital performance, patient discharge trends, and cost efficiency** using Power BI. The project provides data-driven insights to optimize **Length of Stay (LOS)**, **hospital utilization**, and **cost per discharge** across multiple hospitals.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Total Hospitals Analyzed**: 151
- **Total Patient Discharges**: 26,000
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Average Length of Stay (LOS) per Hospital**
  - **Total Discharges by Severity & Risk of Mortality**
  - **Cost per Discharge per Hospital**
  - **Hospital Performance Comparison**

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard Creation & Data Visualization
- **Power Query** – Data Extraction & Preprocessing, Data Cleaning & Structuring

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Identified variations in Length of Stay (LOS)** from **1.4 to 12.0 days**, helping hospitals improve patient turnover and resource allocation.
2. **Analyzed cost per discharge**, showing a wide range from **$7,700 to $85,000**, enabling hospitals to optimize financial efficiency.
3. **Segmented patient discharge data by severity of illness**, highlighting trends that help in hospital capacity planning.
4. **Top-performing hospitals** were identified based on efficiency metrics, guiding best practices for other institutions.

## 🎯 Conclusion
- The dashboard provides **actionable insights** for hospital administrators to **reduce patient stay duration, optimize resource allocation, and control healthcare costs**.
- Further analysis can incorporate **predictive modeling** to anticipate hospital needs and improve patient outcomes.
